# Visualising Fitts' Law with D3

Fitts' Law is one of the cornerstones of user interface research. Published in 1954, Fitts described the relation between the target distance, width, and time needed of a target acquisition task. This later became known as Fitts' law [Fitts 1954].

This interactive illustration of the Fitts test should serve as an introduction to Fitts' law. It can also help the viewer to visualise details not directly covered by it and provide further insights into motion in 2D target acquisition tasks.
